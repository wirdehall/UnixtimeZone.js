# Unixtime.js

Small js lib with a few functions to handel date and time with timezones with unix timestamps as a base.

## Base concept

The basic id√©a is that you use unixtimestamps in UTC as base.
Then you set what timezone offset you want to use for outputing.
This will be set globaly.

## How to use

```
// Offset in hours
setTimezoneOffset(1); // UTC + 1 hour

const unixtime = 1576170268;

console.log(formatTimestamp(unixtime));
// Expected output:  2019-12-12 18:04:28

console.log(formatTimestamp(unixtime, '%y%m%d - %H:%I'));
// Expected output:  191212 - 18:04

console.log(toUnixtime('2019-12-12 18:04:28'));
// Expected output: 1576170268
```

formatTimestamp's second parameter uses syntax similar to strftime but all functionallity is not implemented.

## Known limitations

 * No support for daylight-saving time, you have to handel this on your own since you don't input timezone but timezone offset.
 * formatTimestamp is not fullfeatured for formatting
